# Discord Bot
This is using JavaScript to create a Discord bot. This interacts with [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) to automate commands within my Discord server.

## Dependencies
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)
* [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch)

## Functionality
So far the bot has limited functionality. As of right now the bot can reply to certain messages, either with a gif or with a regular text message. I would like to add several more functions and the possibilities seem endless.
* Reply to specific keywords
* Send gifs
* Send updates (Of what i'm not sure)
* Show user statistics when prompted
* Ban users
* ETC..
